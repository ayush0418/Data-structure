# There are three types of Linked List.

1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List

## Singly Linked List
It is the most common. Each node has data and a pointer to the next node.

## Doubly Linked List
We add a pointer to the previous node in a doubly-linked list. Thus, we can go in either direction: forward or backward.

## Circular Linked List
A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list in which the last element is linked to the first element. This forms a circular loop.

### A circular linked list can be either singly linked or doubly linked.

* For singly linked list, next pointer of last item points to the first item
* In the doubly linked list, prev pointer of the first item points to the last item as well.
